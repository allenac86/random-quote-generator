My first project created in the Treehouse Full-Stack JavaScript boot camp.

This project is a random quote generator that changes quotes and colors (the colors are very ugly, I'm sorry - I'll make it prettier at some point) after 10 seconds or when the "show another quote" button is clicked.

To run:
  - clone repo
  - copy the path of index.html and paste into Chrome browser
